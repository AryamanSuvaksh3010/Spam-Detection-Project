# Spam-Detection-Project
Description:

SpamGuard or SpamDetector is a spammers detection system based on machine learning. It detects and classifies messages as "spam" or "ham," which represents non-spam. This project uses NLP techniques in preprocessing textual information, removing stopwords, and transforming it into a different representation that the machine learning algorithms can use. It then uses the Naive Bayes classifier to predict labels for each message.

It is built with background Python libraries usually applied in managing data, including pandas for the use of the system in handling data, scikit-learn for the training and evaluation of models, and TF-IDF vectorization for extracting features from text. After final model training using a labeled dataset, it is an excellent accuracy rate. In light of this accuracy rate, it would be very effective as a spam-detection tool, especially in emails or messaging platforms.
Features:
Preprocessing: To preprocess, it removes stopwords and converts the text to lowercase for better analysis.
TF-IDF Vectorization: It can transform raw text data into a numerical format for training models.
Naive Bayes Classification: Models the messages as spam or ham, with high level accuracy rates.
Model Evaluation: Validates the model regarding accuracy.
Save the Model and Vectorizer: Saves both the models that are trained and the TF-IDF vectorizer for any possible further use or deployment.
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit
Pickle: to save models
Use Case:
SpamGuard would let an email service or messaging platform integrate its services to filter spams into the mailbox for a cleaner and safer inbox experience.
